    <h2>a. OUR FEES</h2>
    <p>You are expected to pay the full amount for your Service fee before we commence the development of your Software. We reserve the right not to commence any work until we receive the full payment for your service except agreed otherwise.</p>

    <h2>b. SUPPLY OF MATERIALS</h2>
    <p>You must supply everything we need to complete the project on your behalf including the format we need to complete the work in accordance with any agreed specification. Some of the materials to be supplied by you may include but are not limited to images, content, logos, and other printed material you would like to incorporate into our software provided as a service. In the event you delay in supplying these materials to us, which could eventually lead to a delay in the completion of work, we reserve the right to extend any previously agreed deadlines by a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p>Where you fail to supply materials required to build your software, and it prevents the progress of the work leading to a stoppage of the work at hand, we reserve the right to invoice you for any part or parts of the work already completed.</p>

    <h2>c. VARIATIONS</h2>
    <p>We are pleased to offer you the opportunity to make revisions to the design.

    <p>Our software development phase is flexible and allows certain variations to the original specification. However, any major change from the specification will be charged at an additional cost. A minor change is anything that has to do with adjusting of size, change of placement, moving of components, color change, image replacement, or text change. A major change is an addition of a new feature which has direct or indirect effect on the existing database structure been agreed to by Dinolabs Tech Services.
